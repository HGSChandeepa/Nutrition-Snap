# Nutrition Snap : Google - The Gemma 3n Impact Challenge

## Project Goal

To create a culturally intelligent and privacy-focused mobile application that empowers Sri Lankans to manage their health by providing instant, accurate nutritional information for local cuisine — all without an internet connection.

## Key Features

### Image-to-Nutrition Analysis
Users can take a photo of their meal, and the app will instantly identify the food items and provide a detailed nutritional breakdown, including:
- Calories
- Protein
- Carbs
- Fats

This is powered by **on-device AI** for speed and privacy.

### Multi-Food Recognition
The AI is specifically trained to recognize and differentiate multiple food items on a single plate — a crucial feature for complex Sri Lankan "rice and curry" meals.

### AI-Powered Portion Estimation
Using the device’s camera, the app estimates portion sizes by:
- Using a common reference object (e.g., a hand), or
- Providing an interactive on-screen guide

This ensures greater accuracy in nutritional tracking.

### Comprehensive Sri Lankan Food Database
The app includes a **pre-loaded, offline database** with hundreds of:
- Local dishes
- Ingredients
- Packaged goods (e.g., Maliban, Munchee)

This is a **core differentiator**, making the app practical and locally relevant.

### Personalized AI Coach
The on-device AI offers:
- Private, personalized insights
- Dietary suggestions based on history and health goals

For example, it might:
- Recommend a lighter dinner
- Suggest a high-protein local recipe

### 100% Offline and Privacy-First
Everything runs **fully offline**:
- Photo analysis
- Data tracking
- Insights

No personal health data or images **ever leave the device**.

### Multi-Language Support
Available in:
- Sinhala
- Tamil
- English

Making the app accessible to a **broad demographic across Sri Lanka**.
